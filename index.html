                                Sound Transit’s Stride bus rapid transit will be
                                a fast, frequent, and reliable bus service
                                connecting to light rail and to communities
                                north, east, and south of Lake Washington.
                                Similar to light rail service, Stride is
                                designed for convenient travel with fast
                                arrivals and departures, including off-board
                                fare payment and multiple-door entry and exit.
                                New bus lanes and transit priority improvements
                                help riders avoid traffic. Our Stride bus fleet
                                will include battery electric buses (BEBs) for a
                                cleaner more sustainable way to travel in the
                                region. Our Stride program will also include a
                                new bus maintenance base in Bothell to guarantee
                                a safe, clean and comfortable ride for Sound
                                Transit passengers. The S1, S2, and S3 bus lines
                                together form the Stride program.

                                The S1 and S2 Stride Lines, formerly known as
                                I-405 bus rapid transit in the project’s
                                planning phase, will connect communities along
                                I-405 and SR 518 from Lynnwood to Burien. S1
                                runs from Burien to Bellevue and S2 runs from
                                Bellevue to Lynnwood. With buses running as
                                often as every 10 minutes, this new service will
                                connect to Link light rail at Lynnwood, Bellevue
                                and Tukwila, the S3 Stride line in Bothell, and
                                to other transit services provided by Sound
                                Transit, Community Transit and King County
                                Metro. The project includes a new transit center
                                in South Renton and 10 Stride stations, three of
                                which will also add parking, for a total of
                                1,300 new spaces. The parking at the South
                                Renton Transit Center in 2034 and Totem
                                Lake/Kingsgate station in Kirkland is
                                anticipated to be completed in 2035. The S1 and
                                S2 Lines build upon the Washington State
                                Department of Transportation's I-405 Master Plan
                                with roadway improvements for faster travel. We
                                are partnering with WSDOT to design and
                                construct several of the Stride stations along
                                these service lines.

                                145th bus rapid transit, will serve the growing
                                north Lake Washington communities from Shoreline
                                and Seattle to Bothell. This BRT corridor will
                                use battery electric buses to connect riders to
                                Link light rail at Shoreline South/148th at the
                                west end of the corridor, and at the east end of

                                Stride stations, and will add parking in Kenmore
                                and Bothell, anticipated to be complete in 2034,
                                and in Lake Forest Park, anticipated by 2044.

                                You can recognize Stride buses by their blue,

                        Our projects reach various milestones—30%, 60%, and 90%
                        design—during the design phase that are associated with
                        a general level of design "completeness." The 30% design
                        phase was completed in 2021 and 2022, and we are now at
                        60% design for the Stride program At final design, the
                        plans are finalized and made ready for construction.

                    <p>
                        We anticipate starting construction in 2024/2025 and
                        starting service on some lines as early as 2026/2027.

                                Included in the 2016 voter-approved Sound
                                Transit 3 measure, the Stride program will
                                provide fast, frequent, and reliable transit
                                service to people living and working along I-405
                                and SR 522. New Stride connections from Bellevue
                                to Burien, Lynnwood to Bellevue, and Shoreline
                                and Seattle to Bothell build upon Sound
                                Transit’s commitment to equitable, accessible,
                                and affordable transportation. With projected
                                population growth across the Puget Sound, Stride
                                is a 19-hour a day service that will meet more
                                people’s transportation needs and connect the
                                region in new and faster ways. There is no need
                                to look at a bus schedule for Stride since buses
                                come every 10 to 15 minutes. It offers an easy
                                alternative to driving congested roadways—
                                bypassing traffic on I-405 in the Express toll
                                lanes and building Business Access and Transit
                                lanes on SR 522. Stride connects to Link light
                                rail stations, where you can hop on a train to a
                                Mariners game or to SeaTac Airport, and
                                eventually take light rail all the way to
                                Everett or Tacoma. S3 stops along the
                                Burke-Gilman trail, so you can enjoy a scenic
                                walk or bike ride to Stride stations.

                                In the face of the pandemic and steeply rising
                                cost pressures across the Puget Sound region,
                                the Sound Transit Board of Directors took action
                                in August 2021 to ensure our voter-approved
                                transit expansion program remains affordable.

                                This critical work addressed an estimated $6.5
                                billion affordability gap for delivering
                                projects on their previous schedules, due to
                                regional real estate and construction costs
                                driving up future project estimates.

                                and engagement with jurisdictions and
                                stakeholders, the Board adopted a realignment

                                timeline, future construction schedule, project
                                design and impacts, and station design and
                                locations. Summaries of previous public outreach
                                efforts are available on our project websites
                                within the documents section.

                        project-related questions. We contacted individual
                        property owners to begin the property acquisition
                        process between September 2021 and February 2023.

                                            Kenmore, and Bothell were invited in

                                            January 2020 and August 2021.
                                            In-person property owner meetings
                                            were shifted to virtual meetings due
                                            to social distancing recommendations
                                            for COVID-19. Property owner were

                                            the 30% design milestone, and the
                                            project team held an online open
                                            house and virtual townhalls to share
                                            the latest design information. Based
                                            on feedback from property owners,
                                            the route alignment in Lake Forest
                                            Park was shifted to the west of SR
                                            522 to minimize the number of
                                            property owners that would require
                                            relocation.

                                            Property owners were offered

                        To reach the 60% design milestone, we’ve continued
                        conversations with jurisidictions and communities along
                        the corridors to ensure the project meets jurisdictional
                        code requirements and the needs of residents and riders.
                        We will continue to work with jurisdictions and property
                        owners to refine designs.

                                    Over 40 BRT stations total along the S1, S2,
                                    and S3 lines. The typical shelter will be
                                    48-feet long and most will have ticket
                                    vending machines, ORCA card readers, and

                                    Throughout the S3 Line, the design changed
                                    to create significantly larger, more
                                    accessible stations. At 30% design, all of
                                    the S3 stations were planned to be 4 bays
                                    and the size increased to 6 bays.

                                The 145th Street and I-5 Interchange Project
                                will improve safety and multimodal access along
                                the 145th Street corridor and help connect to
                                the future Sound Transit Shoreline South/148th
                                Light Rail Station, planned to open in 2024. The
                                interchange improvements will alleviate traffic
                                congestion and enhance transportation mobility,
                                reliability, and safety for all users, including
                                pedestrians, bicyclists, transit, and freight.

                                The I-405, Brickyard to SR 527 Improvement
                                Project lies primarily in Bothell on Interstate
                                405 (I-405), starting just south of the SR 522
                                interchange and ending at the SR 527
                                interchange. The communities in this vicinity
                                will see major improvements in added express
                                toll lane capacity, direct access to state
                                highways and improved connections to regional
                                transit service at both the UW Bothell Station
                                (SR 522) and Canyon Park Park and Ride (SR 527),
                                integrating corridor investments with Sound
                                Transit’s planned opening of I-405 Bus Rapid
                                Transit. The Brickyard station in Bothell will
                                be a new transit-only inline Stride station
                                facility to support I-405 Bus Rapid Transit,
                                improving connections to the existing park and
                                ride.

                                The project will enhance four and a half miles
                                of the corridor with a focus on both the main
                                project expansion and overall operational
                                improvements. The project will build one new
                                express toll lane in each direction between
                                south of SR 522 and SR 527 (extending the
                                existing dual express toll lane system), widen
                                I-405 through the SR 522 interchange and build
                                direct access ramps to the express toll lanes at
                                SR 522, and build a partial direct access
                                interchange at SR 527 to and from the south
                                connecting to the Canyon Park Park and Ride. The
                                project will include additional local roadway
                                improvements, fish barrier corrections, noise
                                walls, and new stormwater facilities.

                                existing HOV lane with the new lane to create a
