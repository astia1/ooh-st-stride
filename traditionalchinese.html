            <p>
              Sound Transit’s Stride bus rapid transit will be
              a fast, frequent, and reliable bus service
              connecting to light rail and to communities
              north, east, and south of Lake Washington.
              Similar to light rail service, Stride is
              designed for convenient travel with fast
              arrivals and departures, including off-board
              fare payment and multiple-door entry and exit.
              New bus lanes and transit priority improvements
              help riders avoid traffic. Our Stride bus fleet
              will include battery electric buses (BEBs) for a
              cleaner more sustainable way to travel in the
              region. Stride routes will replace existing ST Express service currently operated by transit partners.
              Route 560 will be replaced by S1: I-405 South, Route 535 will be replaced by S2: I-405 North, and Route
              522 will be replaced by S3. Stride buses will connect to Link Light Rail and provide new ways for you to
              get to your destination. Our Stride program will also include a
              new bus maintenance base in Bothell to guarantee
              a safe, clean and comfortable ride for Sound
              Transit passengers. The S1, S2, and S3 bus lines
              together form the Stride program.
            </p>

            <h3>What are S1 and S2?</h3>
            <p>
              The S1 and S2 Stride Lines, formerly known as
              I-405 bus rapid transit in the project’s
              planning phase, will connect communities along
              I-405 and SR 518 from Lynnwood to Burien. S1
              runs from Burien to Bellevue and S2 runs from
              Bellevue to Lynnwood. With buses running as
              often as every 10 minutes, this new service will
              connect to Link light rail at Lynnwood, Bellevue
              and Tukwila, the S3 Stride line in Bothell, and
              to other transit services provided by Sound
              Transit, Community Transit and King County
              Metro. The project includes a new transit center
              in South Renton and 10 Stride stations, three of
              which will also add parking, for a total of
              1,300 new spaces. The parking at the South
              Renton Transit Center and at Northeast 44th Street is anticipated to be completed in 2034. The Totem
              Lake/Kingsgate station in Kirkland is
              anticipated to be completed in 2035. The S1 and
              S2 Lines build upon the Washington State
              Department of Transportation's I-405 Master Plan
              with roadway improvements for faster travel. We
              are partnering with WSDOT to design and
              construct several of the Stride stations along
              these service lines.
            </p>

            <h3>S1 and S2 Lines save on your travel time</h3>

            <img class="pix" src="imgs/Travel-times-S.jpg"
              alt="Stride saves time during AM peak hour travel times to Bellevue. On the North Line from Lynnwood to Bellevue, ST express currently takes 57 minutes. The S2 line proposed refined project will take between 46 and 51 minutes and with north express toll lanes is will be as fast as 33 to 38 minutes. On the South Line from Burien to Bellevue, ST Express takes about 55 minutes. The S2 line will take an estimated 38 to 42 minutes." />
            <h3>What is S3?</h3>

            <p>
              The S3 Stride Line, formerly known as SR 522/NE
              145th bus rapid transit, will serve the growing
              north Lake Washington communities from Shoreline
              and Seattle to Bothell. The project includes 14
              Stride stations. The S3 Line will connect riders to
              Link light rail at Shoreline South/148th at the
              west end of the corridor, and at the east end of
              the corridor to the S2 line in Bothell. S2 and S3 will connect at the SR
              522/I-405 Transit Hub with transit service
              provided by Sound Transit, Community Transit and
              King County Metro. Stride will add parking in Kenmore
              and Bothell, anticipated to be complete in 2034,
              and in Lake Forest Park, anticipated to be complete in 2044. 
            </p>

            <h3>
              The S3 Line will reduce your transit travel time
            </h3>
            <img class="pix" src="imgs/S3 Stride Travel times graphic 2023.jpg"
              alt="The Stride S3 line during evening peak traffic times Eastbound from Shoreline to Bothell currently takes about 54 minutes. The S3 line will cut that time down to 39 minutes. In the morning peak times going Westbound from Bothell to Shoreline, it currently takes 59 minutes via transit. S3 will cut that time down to 35 minutes. " />

            <h3>Stride Fleet</h3>
            <p>
              You can recognize Stride buses by their blue,
              yellow, and white colors. The Stride branding
              makes them easy to spot. There will be a
              fleet of double decker buses on S1 and S2 as well as articulated buses on S3. Stride will also feature a
              brand new fleet of
              battery electric buses. See a
              preview of the bus design below:

        <h3>Stride has come a long way since the planning phase</h3>
        <p>
          Our projects reach various milestones —30%, 60%, and 90%
          design— during the design phase that are associated with
          a general level of design "completeness." The 30% design
          phase was completed in 2021 and 2022, and we are now at
          60% design for the Stride program. At final design, the
          plans are finalized and made ready for construction. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We anticipate starting construction in 2024/2025 and
          starting service on some lines as early as 2026/2027.
        </p>
        <div class="container">

            <p>
              Included in the 2016 voter-approved Sound
              Transit 3 measure, the Stride program will
              provide fast, frequent, and reliable transit
              service to people living and working along I-405
              and SR 522. New Stride connections from Bellevue
              to Burien, Lynnwood to Bellevue, and Shoreline
              and Seattle to Bothell build upon Sound
              Transit’s commitment to equitable, accessible,
              and affordable transportation. With projected
              population growth across the Puget Sound, Stride
              is a 19-hour-a-day service that will meet more
              people’s transportation needs and connect the
              region in new and faster ways. There is no need
              to look at a bus schedule for Stride, since buses
              come every 10 to 15 minutes. It offers an easy
              alternative to driving congested roadways,
              bypassing traffic on I-405 in the Express toll
              lanes and building Business Access and Transit
              lanes on SR 522. Stride lines will work with regional partners to provide more service in addition to
              integrating with Sound Transit Link service. Stride's connections to light rail can take you to a
              Mariners game or the Sea-Tac Airport and
              eventually all the way to
              Everett or Tacoma. S3 stops along the
              Burke-Gilman trail, so you can enjoy a scenic
              walk or bike ride to Stride stations.

            <p>
              In the face of the pandemic and steeply rising
              cost pressures across the Puget Sound region,
              the Sound Transit Board of Directors took action
              in August 2021 to ensure our voter-approved
              transit expansion program remains affordable.
            </p>
            <p>
              This critical work addressed an estimated $6.5
              billion affordability gap for delivering
              projects on their previous schedules, due to
              regional real estate and construction costs
              driving up future project estimates.
            </p>
            <p>
              After 17 months of staff and Board discussions
              and engagement with jurisdictions and
              stakeholders, the Board adopted a realignment
              plan on Aug. 5, 2021. Learn more about the
              Board’s action in our
              <a href="https:https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/sound-transit-board-adopts-plan-delivering-critical-transit-expansions-quickly?utm_campaign=pu-sr522brt-20210817&utm_content=realignment&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery"

            <p>
              Based on current revenue projections and cost
              estimates, the Board’s adopted plan identifies:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                2026/2027 as the timeframe we can afford to
                begin service on the SR 522/NE 145th BRT
                project (Stride S3).
              </li>
              <li>
                2026/2027 as the timeframe we can afford to
                open service on the south Stride bus rapid
                transit line from Burien to Bellevue (the S1
                Line), and complete construction of the NE
                85th Station on the north line.
              </li>
              <li>
                2026/2027 as the timeframe we can afford to
                open service on the north line from Bellevue
                to Lynnwood (the S2 Line). This service date
                is also coordinated with WSDOT’s I-405,
                Brickyard to SR 527 Improvement Project.
              </li>
              <li>
                2034 as the timeframe we can afford to
                provide additional parking in Kenmore and
                Bothell.
              </li>
              <li>
                2044 as the timeframe we can afford to
                provide parking in Lake Forest Park.
              </li>
              <li>
                2034 as the timeframe we can afford to
                provide parking at NE 44th in Renton and the
                South Renton Transit Center.
              </li>
              <li>
                2035 as the timeframe we can afford to
                provide additional parking at Kingsgate in
                Kirkland.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Project costs are being tracked closely as we
              work with partner jurisdictions and stakeholders
              to advance Stride projects. The projects’
              ultimate timelines will come into greater focus
              as we advance project design and property
              acquisition, including examining cost-saving
              options.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our path forward will be shaped by determined
              efforts to secure expanded funding. Close
              collaboration with partners will be required to
              deliver projects as rapidly as possible.

              Sound Transit has completed a State
              Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) environmental
              checklist for our Stride projects: I-405 BRT, SR
              522 BRT and Bus Base North operation and
              maintenance facility. Based on the checklist,
              technical reports and other information, Sound
              Transit has determined that the Stride projects
              do not have a probable significant adverse
              impact on the environment and issued a
              Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS) for each
              project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sound Transit continues to track project design
              for changes to the environmental impacts
              documented in the SEPA process and the potential
              need for additional evaluation of impacts and
              mitigation.

              comments. Your thoughts help us better
              understand the communities we serve. Since 2018,
              we’ve met with approximately 80 community
              organizations, 130 property owners, and
              thousands of community members at local events.
              A few common themes we’ve heard from the public
              are questions and comments around project
              timeline, future construction schedule, project
              design and affects, and station design and
              locations. Summaries of previous public outreach
              efforts are available on our project websites
              within the documents section.

        <h3>Working with property owners</h3>
        <p>
          As the design continues to advance, we are continuing
          conversations on individual site plans and answering
          project-related questions. We contacted individual
          property owners to begin the property acquisition
          process between September 2021 and February 2023.

                    The project team has actively

                    be affected by the project since
                    early in the design process.
                    Property owners in Seattle,
                    Shoreline, on the east side of SR
                    522 in Lake Forest Park, on the west
                    side of SR 522 in Lake Forest Park,
                    Kenmore, and Bothell were invited in
                    phases to discuss how the project
                    may impact their property
                    specifically and to answer
                    project-related questions between
                    January 2020 and August 2021.
                    In-person property owner meetings
                    were shifted to virtual meetings due
                    to social distancing recommendations
                    for COVID-19. Property owners were
                    notified of other opportunities to
                    engage with the project and project
                    information through mail, email and
                    project updates.

                    In March 2021, the project reached
                    the 30% design milestone and the
                    project team held an online open
                    house and virtual town halls to share
                    the latest design information. Based
                    on feedback from property owners,
                    the route alignment in Lake Forest
                    Park was shifted to the west of SR
                    522 to minimize the number of
                    property owners that would require
                    relocation.

                    project-related questions from
                    property owners and neighborhood groups and meet with them
                    on request as design refinements

                    the project. Due to the pandemic, property owner engagement

                    Sound Transit has refined the design
                    of the Stride program to minimize
                    the number of property owners that
                    would require relocation, and the
                    great majority of the properties
                    impacted as part of the program
                    involve only partial acquisitions
                    and temporary construction
                    easements. However, in a small
                    number of cases, a project impact is
                    so great to a particular property
                    that an owner/tenant may be
                    displaced in the process. Should
                    that occur, displaced individuals or

          To reach the 60% design milestone, we’ve continued
          conversations with jurisidictions and communities along
          the corridor to ensure the project meets jurisdictional
          code requirements and the needs of residents and riders.
          We will continue to work with jurisdictions and property
          owners to refine designs. In each section, you can find design updates and roll plots as they are available.

                Over 40 BRT stations total along the S1, S2, and S3 lines. The typical shelter will be
                48 feet long and most will have ticket
                vending machines, ORCA card readers and

            <p>
              Travelers on I-405 between Renton and
              Bellevue experience one of the state’s worst
              commutes. The I-405 Renton to Bellevue Widening
              and Express Toll Lanes project includes
              multimodal transportation and safety
              improvements to offer more reliable travel
              choices and keep drivers, transit riders and
              freight moving.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Renton to Bellevue project will add new
              capacity to create a two-lane Express Toll Lane (ETL) system between
              SR 167 in Renton and Northeast 6th Street in
              Bellevue. In general, the project will add one
              new lane in each direction and combine the
              existing HOV lane with the new lane to create a
              dual ETL system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The new ETLs will connect to the existing
              express toll lane system between Bellevue and
              Lynnwood, as well as the SR 167 HOT lanes via
              the I-405/SR 167 Interchange Direct Connector,
              to create a 40-mile ETL system. This project is
              designed to improve speeds and trip reliability
              for all travelers and support the new I-405 Bus
              Rapid Transit (BRT) line between Lynnwood and
              Tukwila included in the voter-approved Sound

            <p>
              The I-405, Brickyard to SR 527 Improvement
              Project lies primarily in Bothell on I-405, starting just south of the SR 522
              interchange and ending at the SR 527
              interchange. The communities in this vicinity
              will see major improvements in added express
              toll lane capacity, direct access to state
              highways and improved connections to regional
              transit service at both the UW Bothell Station
              (SR 522) and Canyon Park Park- and-Ride (SR 527),
              integrating corridor investments with Sound
              Transit’s planned opening of the S2 Line. The Brickyard station in Bothell will
              be a new transit-only inline Stride station
              facility to support the Stride S2 line,
              improving connections to the existing park and
              ride.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project will enhance 4.5 miles
              of the corridor with a focus on both the main
              project expansion and overall operational
              improvements. The project will build one new
              express toll lane in each direction between
              south of SR 522 and SR 527 (extending the
              existing dual express toll lane system), widen
              I-405 through the SR 522 interchange and build
              direct access ramps to the express toll lanes at
              SR 522, and build a partial direct access
              interchange at SR 527 to and from the south
              connecting to the Canyon Park Park-and-Ride. The
              project will include additional local roadway
              improvements, fish barrier corrections, noise
              walls, and new stormwater facilities.

              145th Street between 5th Avenue NE and the on-
              and off-ramps on the west side of I-5. The
              project will replace the signalized
              intersections on either side of I-5 with
              <a
                href="https://www.shorelinewa.gov/government/departments/public-works/transportation-services/roundabouts">
                roundabouts</a>
              and update lane configurations on the bridge
              over I-5.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 145th Street and I-5 Interchange Project
              will improve safety and multimodal access along
              the 145th Street corridor and help connect to
              the future Sound Transit Shoreline South/148th
              Light Rail Station, planned to open in 2024. The
              interchange improvements will alleviate traffic
              congestion and enhance transportation mobility,
              reliability, and safety for all users, including
              pedestrians, bicyclists, transit, and freight.

                Sound Transit is committed to being a good
                neighbor during construction. We will work to
                manage impacts on surrounding communities by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Maintaining a safe construction site: We
                  fence off construction areas, keep the site
                  tidy, adhere to noise variances, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keeping people moving: We provide safe
                  pedestrian and cyclist routes, shift traffic
                  to accommodate construction impacts, and
                  maintain access to private properties and
                  local neighborhoods.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Protecting the environment: We make sure our
                  work does not have negative impacts on the
                  environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implementing a business relations program:
                  We provide resources to help businesses
                  prepare for construction such as our
                  business toolkit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintain a 24-7 construction telephone
                  hotline: We are available to answer
                  construction questions and hear comments on
                  the project.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Sound Transit may request code variances from
                cities and agency partners to complete work
                outside of typical construction hours to
                progress the overall project.
